  <h1>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h1>

  <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
  bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
  the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
  in it, <q cite="https://openlab.bmcc.cuny.edu/mmp-240-fall-2021/quiz-1-marking-up-text/">and what is the use of a book,
  </q> thought Alice <q cite="https://openlab.bmcc.cuny.edu/mmp-240-fall-2021/quiz-1-marking-up-text/">without
    pictures or conversations?</q></p>

    <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
      for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
      the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
      getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
      with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

<p>There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
  it so <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
<q cite="https://openlab.bmcc.cuny.edu/mmp-240-fall-2021/quiz-1-marking-up-text/">Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!</q>
 (when she thought it over afterwards,
  it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
  but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
  <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,</i> and looked at it, and then
  hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
  that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
  or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
  the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down
  a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
